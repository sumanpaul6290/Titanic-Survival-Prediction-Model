## 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This is a machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using various classification models. The famous Kaggle Titanic competition inspires this project, which provides a full workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question:
“What sorts of people were more likely to survive?”

I analyze the dataset to uncover insights and use machine learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes based on passenger data such as:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)

- Sex

- Age

- Fare

- Family size (SibSp, Parch)

- Embarked location

## 🚀 Features
- Data Exploration & Visualization  
Visual insights into survival patterns and relationships between features.

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature engineering (e.g., creating new variables)

- Model Development  
Trains and compares multiple models:

  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Model Evaluation  
Assesses performance using:

  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Cross-validation scores

- Prediction  
Generates predictions for the test set and explores feature importance.


## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which provides:

- train.csv: Training data with labels

- test.csv: Test data without labels
